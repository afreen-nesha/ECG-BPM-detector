# ECG BPM Detector 

This project is a beginner-friendly Python implementation that processes ECG signals to estimate Beats Per Minute (BPM) using filtering and peak detection. It reads ECG data from a publicly available Kaggle dataset and visualizes key aspects like the raw signal, FFT spectrum, and filtered signal, finally calculating the heart rate.

## Project Highlights

 **Signal Filtering**: Butterworth high-pass and low-pass filters are applied to remove noise.
 **Frequency Analysis**: FFT helps inspect noise and dominant frequencies.
 **R-Peak Detection**: Peaks in the ECG waveform are detected to estimate BPM.
 **Medical Insight**: The analyzed ECG signal frequently displayed a heart rate around **39 BPM**, suggesting **bradycardia** — a condition characterized by an abnormally slow heart rate (typically < 60 BPM).

## Dataset

- Source: [PTB Diagnostic ECG Dataset on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat)
- Sample used: `ptdb_abnormal.csv`

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   ```

2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install numpy pandas matplotlib scipy
   ```

3. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python finalproject.py
   ```
